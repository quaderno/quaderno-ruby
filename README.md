# quaderno-ruby

Quaderno-ruby is a ruby wrapper for [Quaderno API] (https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api).

Current version is 2.1.3 See the changelog [here](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-ruby/blob/master/changelog.md)

## Installation & Configuration

To install add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'quaderno', require: 'quaderno-ruby'
```

To configure just add this to your initializers

```ruby
  Quaderno::Base.configure do |config|
    config.auth_token = 'my_authenticate_token'
    config.url = 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/'
    config.api_version = API_VERSION # Optional, defaults to the API version set in your account
    config.user_agent_header = 'my custom user agent' # Optional, will make support for your account more efficient if you are doing oauth integrations
  end
```

**1.7.1 Breaking changes:** If you are using a configuration based on versions `< '1.7.1'`, you will notice that the old configuration no longer works, so please update your configuration or specify the `1.7.0` version.

## Get authorization data

You can get your account subdomain by grabbing it from your account url or by calling the authorization method with your personal api token.

```ruby
  response = Quaderno::Base.authorization 'my_authenticate_token', environment #=> Quaderno::Base
  response.identity # => {"id"=>737000, "name"=>"Walter White", "email"=>"cooking@br.bd", "href"=>"https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/"}
```

`environment` is an optional argument. By passing `:sandbox`, you will retrieve your credentials for the sandbox environment and not for production.

This will return a hash with the information about your api url, which includes the account subdomain.

## Ping the service
 You can ping the service in order to check if it is up with:

```ruby
  response = Quaderno::Base.ping #=> Quaderno::Base

  response.status #=> Boolean
```

This will return `status: true` if the service is up or `status: false` if it is not.

## Check the rate limit

```ruby
  response = Quaderno::Base.ping #=> Quaderno::Base
  response.rate_limit_info #=>  { :reset=> 4, :remaining=> 0 }

```

This will return a hash with information about the seconds until the rate limit reset and your remaining requests per minute ([check the API documentation for more information](https://github.com/quaderno/quaderno-api#rate-limiting)).

You can also check the rate limit for each request by checking the `rate_limit_info` method on the response:

```ruby

  invoices = Quaderno::Invoice.all #=> Quaderno::Collection
  invoices.rate_limit_info #=> {:reset=> 5, :remaning=>6}

  invoice = Quaderno::Invoice.find INVOICE_ID #=> Quaderno::Invoice
  invoice.rate_limit_info #=> {:reset=>4, :remaining=>5}

  result = invoice.deliver #=> Quaderno::Base
  result.rate_limit_info #=> {:reset=>3, :remaining=>4}

  begin
    deleted_invoice = Quaderno::Invoice.delete(ANOTHER_INVOICE_ID) #=> Quaderno::Invoice
  rescue Quaderno::Exceptions::InvalidSubdomainOrToken => e
    # If the exception is triggered you can check the rate limit on the raised exception
    e.rate_limit_info #=> {:reset=>2, :remaining=>3}
  end

  deleted_invoice.rate_limit_info #=> {:reset=>2, :remaining=>3}

  # etc.
```

## Reading the values

Quaderno-ruby parses all the json responses in human readable data, so you can access each value just like this:

```ruby
  contact.id
  invoice.items
  estimates.payments
  etc.
```

## Exceptions
Quaderno-ruby exceptions raise depending on the type of error:

```ruby
  Quaderno::Exceptions::UnsupportedApiVersion # Raised when the API version set is not supported.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::InvalidSubdomainOrToken # Raised when the credentials are wrong, missing or do not match the permission for some object.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::InvalidID # Raised when the requested resource by ID does not exist in the account context.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::ThrottleLimitExceeded # Raised when the throttle limit is exceeded.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::RateLimitExceeded # Raised when the rate limit is exceeded.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::HasAssociatedDocuments # Raised when trying to delete a contact with associated documents.

  Quaderno::Exceptions::RequiredFieldsEmptyOrInvalid # Raised if the format of the request is right but some validations failed. You can JSON parse the exception message to get which field triggered the exception. For example: '{"errors":{"vat_number":["is not a valid German vat number"]}}'

  Quaderno::Exceptions::ServerError # Raised when Quaderno returns an HTTP response code of the 50X family. Try again later or contact support if the issue persists
```

All those exceptions inherit from `Quaderno::Exceptions::BaseException`.

### Pagination information
Whenever you call the `all` method on one of the classes, the result will be a `Quaderno::Collection`. For example:

```ruby
collection = Quaderno::Contact.all

collection.class #=> Quaderno::Collection
collection.has_more? #=> true
collection.next_page #=> another instance of
```

The `next_page` method is an abstraction for the `created_before` parameter, which you may also use with the `all` method.

```ruby
collection = Quaderno::Contact.all

Quaderno::Contact.all(created_before: collection.last.id)
```

You can also use the `limit` parameter to determine how many results to retrieve. Its default is `25`, and Quaderno will cap the limit at `100`.

```ruby
collection = Quaderno::Contact.all(limit: 50)

collection.length #=> 50
```

### Thread-safe configuration

If you are managing multiple accounts you may need a thread-safe way to configure the credentials. You can do it by passing the credentials on each request:

```ruby
Quaderno::Invoice.all(
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)

Quaderno::Invoice.find(INVOICE_ID,
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)

Quaderno::Invoice.update(INVOICE_ID,
  po_number: '12345',
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)

invoice = Quaderno::Invoice.find(INVOICE_ID,
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)

invoice.add_payment(params) # Credentials are already stored on the Quaderno::Invoice instance from the first request

invoice = Quaderno::Invoice.find(INVOICE_ID,
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)
invoice.remove_payment(PAYMENT_ID) # Credentials are already stored on the Quaderno::Invoice instance from the first request

Quaderno::Invoice.delete(INVOICE_ID,
  api_url: 'https://my_subdomain.quadernoapp.com/api/',
  auth_token: 'my_authenticate_token'
)
```
